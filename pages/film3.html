        <h2>My thoughts</h2>
        <p id="thoughts">Although I am very late to the party when it comes to this movie, I am glad I managed to see it on the the big screen at The Prince Charles Cinema in London.
            Interstellar is an epic space movie, that focuses on the bite size relationships that make up our world. Accompanied by an incredible score from the tried and true Hans Zimmer, Interstellar
            shows us how powerful love can really be.
