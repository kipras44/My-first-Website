        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p id="synopsis">A tale of outsized ambition and outrageous excess, it traces the rise and fall of multiple characters during an era of unbridled decadence and depravity in early Hollywood.</p>

        <h2>My thoughts</h2>
        <p id="thoughts"><em>BABYLON</em> is huge. It's palpable. While Spielberg's <em>The Fabelmans</em> is a love letter to cinema, <em>BABYLON</em> is a fun, but sometimes angry piece of writing.
        Accompanied by an emphatic score, <em>BABYLON</em> follows the tumultous lives of Manny, Jack, Nellie and Sidney.(Played by Diego Calva, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, and Jovan Adepo respectively.) It shows how the lives
        of the very first movie stars eventually caught up to them, and unapologetically shows us how we got to where we are now in cinema. The ending montage will make your spine perk up.</p>
