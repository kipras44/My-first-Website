        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p id="synopsis">A middle-aged Chinese immigrant is swept up into an insane adventure in which she alone can save existence by exploring other universes and connecting with the lives she could have led.</p>

        <h2>My thoughts</h2>
        <p id="thoughts">Easily the feel-good movie of the year, and a deserving Oscar contender, <em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em> catches you off guard in the best way possible. It also explores a
        common theme in the movies of today: multiverse theory. The cast take turns at playing with your heartstrings, in what culminates to be a very beautiful, human story.</p>
